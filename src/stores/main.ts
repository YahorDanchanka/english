Wht do you <br />think of this?</li> </ol> <h1>Etiquette</h1> <p>People around the world say hello and goodbye in different ways. In Asia, many people <strong>bow</strong> when they <strong>greet</strong> each other. This might seem strange to someone in the Middle East. There men sometimes greet each other with a kiss on cheek. In most countries, people shake hands. But in America and Europe the handshake is firm, while in Asia it is often soft. So what do you do when you meet people from other countries? Don&rsquo;t let these customs confuse you. Just be polite. When you meet, say &ldquo;Pleased to meet you&rdquo; and ask &ldquo;How are you&rdquo; When it is time to leave, say &ldquo;It was nice meeting you&rdquo; and &ldquo;I hope we meet again&rdquo;.</p>',
